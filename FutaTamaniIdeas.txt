Tamani gains TAMANI_FLAG_HAPpINESS from you winning and fucking her penis anyway and from you accepting her without a fight, and loses happiness if she loses otherwise

If she has high happiness, you can talk and try to convince her to make more futas

If she accepts, giving her scholar/vitality teas and ?other stat-boosting items and giving her children inceases TAMANI_POWER, when it's high enough, you can start a mass futafication quest chain

Quest chain involves ingredient acquisition, including capturing the omnibus from the factory.

Then you put tamani in charge of the factory, and can choose to let her use the existing equipment (also spreads corruption), rework it to spread no corruption (costs much $$$, slower), or rework it to spread purification (requires lots of $$$ and purification items, slowest).

Factory is new camp, occasionally attacked by demons, can spend money on fortifications, guards, or building pipelines to other areas (e.g. mountain; lake is default) to contaminate the water supply and cause futafication (and corruption/purification) in that area. There are progress trackers. Building a pipeline is a miniquest with a gold cost consisting of a bunch of consecutive battles against enemies from the region.

Diplomacy options with phoenixes/sand witches/tel'aldre/bazaar/marae/fera/lumi/rathazul/harpies?

can infiltrate lethice's dungeon to reduce her forces, or wait for her to attack (final battle replaces final dungeon, happens even if lethice defeated though much weaker)
